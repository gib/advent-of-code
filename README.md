So far all of my solutions are in JavaScript.
I run solutions with node in the directory of the day.

From the project root, `cd` to the day you'd like to run.
```
$ cd 2022/02
$ node solution.js
```

2022 is my first year participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
It really is a lot of fun, especially "talking shop" and sharing solutions.

Thank you [zaccb](https://github.com/zaccb/advent-of-code) for introducing me to
